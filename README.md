# sqlalchemy-challenge

This challenge was fairly difficult owing to the fact my development environment disappeared one day and I had difficulty installing the new tools, hindering my ability to follow along with the course actvities during instruction.

I relied heavily upon some class recordings, lesson plan presentations, provided solved solutions, stackoverflow, pandas documentation, SQLAlchemy documentation, and discussions with classmates Bryan Johnson and James Forrest.
